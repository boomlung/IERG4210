        Ribs are a cut of meat from the ribcage of a domestic pig, beef, or
        sheep. They are a popular food in many cuisines around the world. The
        most common types of ribs are pork ribs, which are taken from the pig's
        ribcage. Pork ribs can be cooked in a variety of ways, including
        grilling, baking, and smoking. They are often seasoned with a dry rub or
        marinade to add flavor. Pork ribs are typically served with a barbecue
        sauce or other condiments.
